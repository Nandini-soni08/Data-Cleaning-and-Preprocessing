# Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing
Cleaned a raw dataset using Python and Pandas by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing text, converting dates, and renaming columns for consistency. Prepared the data for analysis with a clean, structured output saved as a CSV file. Full process documented in a Jupyter Notebook.
